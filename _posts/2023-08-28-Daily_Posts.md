### Plan

Weekly Plan: 
This Week I plan on completeting every hack on the csp list, making my own python project and importing it into the code, and setting up my github pages and ensure it is running. I also plan to look into AWS employment and to start utilizing other libaries to help style and better my code.


### Todo

Hacks:
- [x] Js Output Query
- [x] Python Tricks
- [x] Js Calculator

### What I Did

For the python tricks I updated a brand new quiz ui application with its own question bank and UI/UX components for the user to answer questions.
 
For the JS Calculator I made a simple design for the calculator that refrenced the calculator app on Iphone it used HTML, CSS, JS

For the JS output query I did

For the Python ML Grade Predicter I used the polynomial regression model to predict grades based off user inputs.
