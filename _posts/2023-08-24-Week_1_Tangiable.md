# Lab Notebook

## Hack 1: JavaScript Project - JS Calculator

### Description
For this project, I developed a JavaScript calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Main Modules Used
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Problem Faced
**Problem**: Trying to Import the Code to a Notebook
I encountered an issue while attempting to import the JavaScript calculator code into a notebook. The interactive nature of the calculator made it difficult to directly integrate into the notebook environment.

**Solution**: To overcome this issue, I created a Markdown file within a Jupyter notebook. I included both the HTML and JavaScript code within code blocks in the Markdown file. This allowed me to showcase and explain the code while maintaining its interactivity.

## Hack 2: Python IO - Basic Quiz Application

### Description
In this project, I created a basic interactive quiz application in Python without a graphical user interface (GUI). Users could answer questions through the console.

### Main Module Used
- Python I/O

### Problem Faced
**Problem**: Transitioning from No GUI to GUI Format
After completing the initial version of the quiz application without a GUI, I realized that the user experience could be improved by implementing a graphical interface.

**Solution**: In the second week of development, I updated the quiz application to incorporate a GUI using a Python library like `tkinter`. This transition allowed for a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

## Hack 3: JavaScript Input - Basic Grade Calculator with Data Input

### Description
For this project, I created a basic grade calculator using JavaScript. The calculator takes input from users and provides a grade based on the input data.

### Main Modules Used
- JavaScript

### Problem Faced
**Problem**: Evolving Functionality from Solo to Data-Driven
Initially, I developed a basic grade calculator that performed calculations based on input values provided by the user. However, I realized that a more advanced version could predict grades based on data sent by the user.

**Solution**: To address this, I expanded the functionality of the calculator. I incorporated a data input feature that allowed users to provide data for the calculator to analyze and predict the grade. This enhancement made the calculator more versatile and valuable.
