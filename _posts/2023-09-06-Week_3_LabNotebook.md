# Lab Notebook - Week 3

## Project 1: AI Flappy Bird

### Description
In this project, I worked on creating an AI Flappy Bird game. The goal was to implement a machine learning model that could play the game autonomously.

### Main Modules Used
- `pygame`: Used for building the Flappy Bird game.
- `NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)`: Employed NEAT to train the AI agent.

### Problem Faced
**Problem**: Linking the Machine Learning Model to the Game
One of the major challenges I encountered was linking the machine learning model, which was evolving through NEAT, to the Flappy Bird game. I struggled with integrating the AI agent's decision-making process with the game's mechanics.

**Solution**: I addressed this issue through basic debugging. I thoroughly examined the code responsible for the interaction between the AI agent and the game. By carefully reviewing the logic and making adjustments where needed, I successfully established a connection between the AI model and the game. This allowed the AI to control the bird's actions based on its neural network.

## Project 2: JavaScript Space Invaders

### Description
In this project, I set out to create a Space Invaders game using JavaScript. The objective was to build an interactive and enjoyable game with a focus on the gameplay mechanics.

### Main Modules Used
- `HTML5 Canvas`: Utilized the HTML5 Canvas element for rendering game graphics.
- `JavaScript`: Developed the game logic and functionality using JavaScript.

### Problem Faced
**Problem**: GUI Development
While creating the Space Invaders game, I faced challenges in designing and implementing the game's graphical user interface (GUI). Specifically, I had difficulty with positioning and styling various elements of the game, such as the score display and game over message.

**Solution**: I am currently in the process of fixing this issue. To improve the GUI, I am exploring CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual aspects of the game. Additionally, I am revising the layout and positioning of GUI elements to ensure they are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. This ongoing work aims to create a more engaging and polished gaming experience.
