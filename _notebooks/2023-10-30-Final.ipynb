    "# Exploration of Data Usage. (API's, DataBases, and More) In a Cookie Ecommernce Project!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Intial Usage of JSON**\n",
    "**Objective**: Having a Massive Database of cookie's and their information to iterate through and add to a catalog screen. \\\n",
    "**Execution**. I utilized the a regular Javascript list to be the bases of our api, where the api would return a list in this format\n",
    "```\n",
    "cookies = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        name: \"Choclate\",\n",
    "        url: \"Image/URL\",\n",
    "        price: \"$4.00\",\n",
    "        description: \"Amazing Choclate Cookies\",\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Outcome** This list format that I suggested ended up being a massive help to our group. With its simplistic design the frontend could use a JS map function to call cookies.name or cookies.price etc. When they wanted to show the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our API usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:  Making an API that could store this cookie data for us and export the data to the frontend.\\\n",
    "**Execution**. The API was split into two parts. In the model the data was initalized and created however to have a database of alot of cookies it took time to add in each cookie, especially the image paths to the cookie. So to make this job easier I developed a web scraper to scrape the image paths of various cookies and add it to our data.\\\n",
    "**Results** The result of this scraper was really good. After a hour or two of expiermentation and debugging I was able to grab the image files of various cookies. These images paths can be grabbed by our backend. However the automatic creation of cookies from these images is still being worked on.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "## Front End Implementation\n",
    " \n",
    "**Objective** To call the cookie API, grab it's data and map through the list of data to dynamically create product card components.\\\n",
    "**Execution** First I utilized the JS fetch command to fetch the data from the api and store in a list. I then utilized the Javascript Map function to iterate through the list and create new html components that formed a product card with the current iteration data from the list. This then was styled using my partners CSS grid system.\\\n",
    "**Results** The results were amazing not only did the data get mapped through perfectly and create the html div's img tags p tags and others, but it was able to add the styling components used by our previous cards. We ended up with a amazing catalog page filled with product cards. These product cards included a button that onclick would change the increase state of that cookie indicating the user added it to their cart.\n",
