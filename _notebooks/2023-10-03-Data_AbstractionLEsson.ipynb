    "\n",
    "Earlier we explained how to assign variables and properly name them. However in the code above even though I followed all these steps and properly named them I ran into a error.\n",
    "This is because the types of data, string and int cannot be added. But what are integers and strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python there are multiple types of data that a variable can be, for now lets look at the most commonly use ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are a numerical value going from 1,2,3,4 or -1,2,-3 etc. These are numbers with no decimals and are ussualy called ints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a integer\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    int x = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we call int x to be 3. Normally you don't need to say the data type before the variable in python, however in other languages like JS or C++ you would need to. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a chain of text, numbers or charcters that are all inside of \" \"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a string\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    str Cookies = \" My Fav cookies are Choclate Chip \"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we set a string cookie to be representing the statement that \" My Fav Cookies are Choclate Chip\"  The \" \" marks are what determine it is a string in most coding languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are True or False, and they are used for condtional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a boolean in Python \n",

    "    ChrissieGetsSleep = False\n",

    "    else: \n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a if statement that checks if the boolean variable is currently true and if its true it won't do anything, but if its false it will return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Float\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are a integers that can have decimal values\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 3.1415\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we call int x to be 3.1415, and this is a float because of its decimal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of items in Python. They can contain a mix of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "print(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries in Python\n",

    "## Choosing the Right Data Type in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, choosing the appropriate data type for your variables is essential to ensure efficient and correct program execution. Here's when to use some common data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers (`int`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use integers when you need to represent whole numbers without fractional parts. Integers are suitable for counting, indexing, and performing integer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use floating-point numbers when you need to represent real numbers with decimal points. They are suitable for calculations that involve fractions or decimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings (`str`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use strings when you need to work with text data, such as names, sentences, or any sequence of characters. Strings are versatile and can store both plain text and formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists (`list`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use lists when you need an ordered collection of items that can be modified. Lists are ideal for storing multiple values of the same or different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples (`tuple`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use tuples when you need an ordered collection of items that should remain immutable (unchangeable). Tuples are useful for representing fixed sequences of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries (`dict`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use dictionaries when you need to store key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are efficient for looking up values based on keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets (`set`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or performing set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans (`bool`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use booleans to represent binary values, such as `True` or `False`. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your program using conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### None (`NoneType`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Use `None` when you want to represent the absence of a value or indicate that a variable has no assigned value. It's often used as a placeholder or default initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right data type helps make your code more readable, efficient, and easier to maintain. Understanding the characteristics and limitations of each data type is essential for effective Python programming.\n"
