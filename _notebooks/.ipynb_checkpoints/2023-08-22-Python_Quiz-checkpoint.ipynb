    "A Optimized Python Quiz Application Using Functions, if else statements and storing the users game data locally on their computer. In this code I optimized it from the given code by making a quick ask_question function that can ask the question and compare it to the answer provided in the questions list. I then optimized the main function by storing the questions data there, and calling the ask_question function and providing the data inputted. Then I iterate through the list of questions checking if the answer is correct or wrong using the ask_question function then moving on."
